# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

Hi ðŸ‘‹ this is my 3rd Frontend Mentor project. I am learning a lot from each of these projects I complete!

##Issues I had, feedback on these appreciated:

* My font doesn't match the design's, even though I am using the specified font: Redhat Display at the specified weights.

* I feel like I had to cheat using negative margin to get the music icon and the price <p> to stay next to each other.

* I noticed the pointer on hover is different in the design spec. Not sure if this is supposed to be a custom pointer.
